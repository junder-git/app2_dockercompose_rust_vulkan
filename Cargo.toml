# The `vulkano` crate is the main crate that you must use to use Vulkan.

# Provides the `shader!` macro that is used to generate code for using shaders.

# The Vulkan library doesn't provide any functionality to create and handle windows, as
# this would be out of scope. In order to open a window, we are going to use the `winit` crate.
